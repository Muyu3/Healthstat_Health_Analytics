# HealthStat Hospital Efficiency Analysis

## Project Overview
Efficiency is one of the six key dimensions of healthcare quality. It focuses on minimizing waste — including waste of time, resources, and cost — while maintaining quality outcomes.

In this project, I analyzed the **HealthStat Hip Replacement dataset** to assess hospital efficiency, with a particular focus on **Length of Stay (LOS)** as a key performance indicator. A shorter LOS is generally associated with improved efficiency, reduced costs, and better patient flow.

The analysis was conducted using **Power Query and Power BI**, with the goal of building an interactive dashboard that supports data-driven decision-making for healthcare stakeholders.

## Objectives
The final dashboard was designed to enable stakeholders to:
- Progress through insights in a logical and intuitive flow
- View concise, informative, and interactive visualizations
- Identify drivers of inefficiency and cost
- Support operational and strategic decisions aimed at improving hospital efficiency

## Key Insights
- **Average cost per discharge:** $20,910  
- **Average length of stay (LOS):** 2.65 days  

### Top Factors Increasing LOS and Cost
- Extreme severity of illness  
- Extreme or major risk of mortality  
- Hospitals located in New York City  
- Patient disposition to skilled nursing facilities  

These factors were identified using influencer and segmentation analysis to uncover root causes of inefficiency.
